Drum sequencer, built with samba composition in mind

Doesn't do much right now.
Press space to load the library, then space again to start playing. Because sound can be annoying and horrible for websites, browsers won't load the library unless in response to some user input.

Playback is way slower than it should be. It used to work, it's a bug I must have introduced way back the last time I was working on this.
